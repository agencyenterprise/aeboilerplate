# AEboilerplate

:poop: `Judd suggested maybe something a little bit catchier. I personally think it's fine but if anyone has suggestions, let me know. I'm also thinking it might be good to list (not bulletpoints) the main technologies in our stack off the bat since developers often look for this right away` :poop:
A lightweight full-stack React/Node/Typescript web project starter that focuses primarily on ease-of-use and simplicity.

AEboilerplate is an *opinionated* boilerplate that includes independent client and API applications packaged into one repository. It is ready to be run and deployed out-of-the-box and comes preconfigured with state management, continuous integration, testing, code-formatting, and much more.

## Introduction

At [AE Studio](https://ae.studio/), we are constantly working on new projects and find ourselves spending time setting up applications that could be better used to build out features. To improve our process, we decided to take our favorite technologies and bundle them into a simple boilerplate to help kickstart our projects faster.


## Features
  
:poop: `Add a little bit of detail for each point and clean up` :poop:

* **Easy to setup**
	* Initial setup is as simple as running a single command
* **Opinionated**
	* We spent a lot of time thinking about which technologies would allow us to build applications out more quickly and guardrails to keep our codebase neat and maintainable.
* **Lightweight**
	* It’s easy to fall into the trap of wanting to use all the latest tools out there to bootstrap your application without realizing that we’re adding unnecessary complexity and bloat. We’ve stripped down the boilerplate to include only what we consider essential in starting a project.
  * :poop: `Would you consider the boilerplate lightweight? If so, what's a better way of highlighting how light it is? I ask because above we say that it's lightweight, but then it also says how it comes with all these features prepackaged.` :poop:
* **Customizable**
	* Localized configurations for easier management 
  * :poop: `What are some other things we can say here?` :poop:

The boilerplate uses the following technologies:

:poop: `Keep it very high level and maybe a very short description about what they’re used for. Please add links and anything else that I’ve missed` :poop:

* Redux - state management 
* Postgres database - data persistence
* CircleCI - continuous integration
* Docker - development
* Knex - query building, seeding, migrations
* Prettier, tslint - code formatting
* Jest - testing
* Google and LinkedIn Authentication
