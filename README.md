A full-stack React/Node/Typescript web project starter that focuses primarily on ease-of-use and simplicity.

AEboilerplate is an _opinionated_ boilerplate that includes independent client and API applications packaged into one repository. It is ready to be run and deployed out-of-the-box and comes preconfigured with state management, continuous integration, testing, code-formatting, and much more.

- **Easy to setup**: Initial setup is as simple as running a single command.

- **Opinionated**: We spent a lot of time thinking about which technologies would allow us to build applications out more quickly with guardrails in place to keep our codebase tidy and maintainable.

- **Clean**: We try to follow the KISS (Keep it simple, stupid) pattern. So we built this boilerplate adding what every robust application needs and more.

- **Customizable**: Configurations are localized for easier management.

## Motivation

At [AE Studio](https://ae.studio/), we are constantly working on new projects and find ourselves spending time setting up applications that could be better used to build out features. To improve our process, we decided to take our favorite technologies and bundle them into a boilerplate to help kickstart our projects faster.
